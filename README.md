# DISCLAIMER & CAUTIONARY NOTES
- Don't rely on price prediction and direction if you don't know the basics of risk-management, stock volatility, and entry, sell patterns. Many people buy high and SL and call it wrong prediction instead of accepting their own mistakes. I created this to tell myself how to be patient to buy the dips in a bull run, while knowing the macro-economics are 50-50 past Fed Rates Cut. Also, many companies were trading at 200W averages so I felt that I need some entry points and directions to maintain 3-5% profits and buy the dips.
- My guide will be to trade patterns and get help from this algorithm to see what the upcoming 2-Weeks can be. Patterns like Consolidation, Multiple Bottoms, Prices below 200-periods, etc, will guide you better enteries.
- I don't do shorting and I'm a buyer. So, I do uni-directional trade.

# ChatGPT FEEDBACK ON PREDICTIONS
When using the provided `predict_prices` function for price prediction, several potential drawbacks and limitations can affect the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. Here are the key cons to consider:

1. **Error Accumulation from Sequential Predictions**
   - **Explanation**: The function updates the `last_data` DataFrame with each predicted price and uses these predictions as inputs for future forecasts. Any errors in early predictions can propagate and compound over subsequent days, leading to increasingly inaccurate forecasts.
   - **Impact**: This can result in significant deviations from actual prices, such as predicting an upward trend while the actual price falls.

2. **Overfitting to Historical Data**
   - **Explanation**: If the model is trained extensively on historical data with specific patterns, it may not generalize well to new, unseen data. The reliance on technical indicators that performed well historically doesn't guarantee future performance.
   - **Impact**: The model might perform poorly in changing market conditions, failing to capture new trends or reacting inadequately to sudden market shifts.

3. **Limited Feature Set**
   - **Explanation**: The function uses a predefined set of technical indicators, which may not encompass all relevant factors influencing price movements. Important variables like macroeconomic indicators, news sentiment, or geopolitical events are excluded.
   - **Impact**: Missing key drivers of price changes can reduce the model's predictive power and lead to inaccurate forecasts.

4. **Lagging Indicators and Delayed Responses**
   - **Explanation**: Many technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA) are inherently lagging, meaning they react to past price movements rather than predicting future changes. This lag can delay the model's response to new market conditions.
   - **Impact**: The model might miss rapid price movements or trend reversals, causing predictions to lag behind actual price changes.

5. **Scaling and Data Leakage Concerns**
   - **Explanation**: The scaler is applied to the input features during prediction, but if the scaler was fit on the entire dataset (including future data), it introduces data leakage. Even if not, continuously scaling with an unchanged scaler may not adapt to new data distributions.
   - **Impact**: Data leakage can lead to overly optimistic performance during training but poor generalization in real-world scenarios. Inadequate scaling can distort feature relationships, reducing prediction accuracy.

6. **Assumption of Market Continuity**
   - **Explanation**: The function assumes that the market continues in a similar pattern based on past data, neglecting unforeseen events like economic shocks, earnings reports, or regulatory changes that can cause abrupt price movements.
   - **Impact**: Such assumptions can lead to significant prediction errors during periods of market volatility or unexpected events.

7. **Handling of Candlestick Patterns**
   - **Explanation**: The `add_candlestickpatterns` function relies on accurate pattern detection, which can be subjective and may not always capture the nuances of price action. Incorrect pattern recognition can mislead the model.
   - **Impact**: Misclassified patterns can introduce noise into the feature set, degrading the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

8. **Computational Efficiency and Scalability**
   - **Explanation**: Recalculating all technical indicators and updating the DataFrame in each iteration can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or longer prediction horizons.
   - **Impact**: This can lead to increased processing time and resource consumption, making the function less practical for real-time or large-scale applications.

9. **No Incorporation of Uncertainty or Confidence Intervals**
   - **Explanation**: The model provides point estimates without any measure of uncertainty. It doesn't account for the inherent unpredictability of financial markets.
   - **Impact**: Without confidence intervals, it's difficult to assess the reliability of predictions, which is crucial for risk management and decision-making.

10. **Potential Issues with Window Size Selection**
    - **Explanation**: The fixed `window_size` of 30 may not capture all relevant historical information, especially for assets with longer-term dependencies or different trading behaviors.
    - **Impact**: An inappropriate window size can lead to missing important patterns or including irrelevant data, thereby affecting the model's performance.

11. **Ignoring Non-Stationarity of Financial Time Series**
    - **Explanation**: Financial time series data are typically non-stationary, meaning their statistical properties change over time. The model may not adequately account for these changes.
    - **Impact**: Non-stationarity can lead to model instability and reduced accuracy, as the underlying data distribution shifts.

12. **No Mechanism for Updating with New Actual Data**
    - **Explanation**: The prediction loop relies solely on historical and predicted data without incorporating new actual data that may become available during the prediction horizon.
    - **Impact**: Failing to update with real-time data can make the predictions less responsive to recent market developments.

13. **Simplistic Handling of New Rows and NaN Values**
    - **Explanation**: The function adds new rows with `NaN` values before updating the 'Close' price. This simplistic handling might not account for other necessary fields or data integrity.
    - **Impact**: Incomplete or improperly handled data rows can lead to errors in indicator calculations or model inputs, further degrading prediction quality.

### Recommendations to Mitigate These Cons

To address these limitations and improve the robustness of your price prediction model, consider the following strategies:

- **Implement Error Correction Mechanisms**: Use techniques like ensemble models or incorporate feedback loops to mitigate the impact of prediction errors.
- **Expand the Feature Set**: Include additional relevant features such as macroeconomic indicators, sentiment analysis from news or social media, and other fundamental data.
- **Use Advanced Scaling Techniques**: Apply scaling methods that adapt to new data distributions or incorporate scaling within cross-validation to prevent data leakage.
- **Incorporate Real-Time Data Updates**: Allow the model to update with new actual data during the prediction process to maintain accuracy.
- **Include Uncertainty Estimates**: Use models that provide confidence intervals or probabilistic forecasts to better understand prediction reliability.
- **Optimize Window Size and Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different window sizes and feature selection methods to capture the most relevant information.
- **Handle Non-Stationarity**: Apply techniques like differencing, transformation, or use models that can adapt to changing data distributions.
- **Enhance Computational Efficiency**: Optimize the code for performance, possibly by precomputing indicators or using more efficient data structures.

By carefully considering and addressing these cons, you can enhance the effectiveness and reliability of your price prediction model.
