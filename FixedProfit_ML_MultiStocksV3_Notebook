## Multi-Stock Machine Learning Prediction Framework

This project delivers a powerful framework to analyze and predict stock price movements across multiple companies using machine learning and technical analysis.

### Key Features

- **Configurable Settings:** Easily customize date ranges, stock selections, risk parameters, and technical analysis windows to tailor the system for your needs.

- **Rich Technical Indicators:** Automatically computes a wide range of important market signals such as moving averages, volatility measures, volume patterns, candlestick formations, and support/resistance pivots.

- **Advanced Labeling:** Applies intelligent logic to label entries and exits based on profit targets and stop-loss levels, helping the machine learning model learn from real market outcomes.

- **Robust Machine Learning Models:** Uses XGBoost regression to forecast expected returns and optimal entries, providing actionable signals backed by solid statistical foundations.

- **Insightful Visualizations:** Generates clear, dual-panel charts showing price trends and model predictions, enriched with dynamically colored signals to highlight bullish and bearish trends.

### How It Works

1. **Data Gathering:** Taps into historical stock data to build a comprehensive view of market behavior over meaningful time spans.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracts meaningful signals by calculating dozens of technical indicators, capturing everything from momentum shifts to volume spikes.

3. **Label Creation:** Designs forward-looking labels identifying whether profit targets or stop-losses are likely to be hit, for effective supervised learning.

4. **Model Training:** Trains sophisticated regression models to predict expected returns and entry price optimizations using the engineered features.

5. **Prediction and Visualization:** Applies models to generate trade signals and visualize the results for easy decision-making.

With this framework, traders and analysts can harness machine learning and technical analysis in an integrated workflow that is both extensible and interpretableâ€”bringing you closer to smarter, data-driven trading decisions.
